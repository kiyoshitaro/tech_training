# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
# same or another computer environment.
# 
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
# restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
# You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
# this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
# 
# Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes
# a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please
# be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        def preorder(node):
            if not node:
                return "N"
            return str(node.val) + "," + preorder(node.left) + ',' + preorder(node.right)
        return preorder(root)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        def desPreorder(deque):
            if deque[0] == 'N':
                deque.popleft()
                return None
            node = TreeNode(int(deque[0]))
            deque.popleft()
            node.left = desPreorder(deque)
            node.right = desPreorder(deque)
            return node
        
        queue = collections.deque(data.split(','))
        return desPreorder(queue)

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# ser = Codec()
# deser = Codec()
# ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root))
