## Define
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.


## Solution
Adapter is a special object that **converts the interface of one object** so that another object can understand it.

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate
