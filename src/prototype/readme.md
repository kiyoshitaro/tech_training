## Define
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you **copy existing objects**  making your code **independent** on their classes.

## Solution
Implementation of the **clone** method
An object that supports cloning is called a prototype
When you need an object like the one youâ€™ve configured, you just clone a prototype instead of constructing a new object from scratch.
