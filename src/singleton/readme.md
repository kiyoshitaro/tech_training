## Define
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Problem

Ensure that a class has just a single instance: (to control access to some shared resource)

Provide a global access point to that instance: (code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app.)
