{"result": "Given the provided text, it appears to be in Vietnamese and seems to discuss astrological or metaphysical concepts rather than providing clear information about specific entities such as organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events in a straightforward manner. Without a direct translation or context that aligns with the entity types specified (organization, person, geo, event), it's challenging to accurately identify and describe entities and their relationships as per the instructions.\n\nHowever, attempting to adhere to the task's requirements and based on the assumption that no specific entities fitting the given types can be discerned from the text snippet provided, no entities or relationships can be identified.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
