{"result": "Given the provided text and the entity types (organization, person, geo, event), the text appears to be in Vietnamese and discusses various concepts related to astrology, fortune, and possibly career paths within a governmental or authoritative context. However, without a direct translation or more context, identifying specific entities of the types requested (organization, person, geo, event) is challenging. The text mentions various astrological terms and concepts that might not directly map to the requested entity types without additional context or interpretation. \n\nGiven these constraints, the output based on the provided instructions and the nature of the text would be minimal as it stands. The text seems to discuss astrological influences on career and fortune, particularly in relation to positions of authority or within a governmental framework, but without specific names, places, organizations, or events mentioned in a way that fits the requested entity types, no entities or relationships can be confidently extracted based on the given instructions.\n\nTherefore, the output for this task, given the text and the constraints, is:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
