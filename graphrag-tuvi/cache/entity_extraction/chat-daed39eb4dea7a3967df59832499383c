However, without specific names, locations, organizations, or events mentioned, and considering the language barrier and the incomplete nature of the text, identifying entities and relationships as per the instructions is challenging. Based on the context and the fragment provided, it seems to describe a group of people with exceptional mental and physical resilience, possibly in a philosophical or spiritual context, rather than mentioning specific entities related to the given types. Therefore, without further context or a complete passage, it's not feasible to extract entities and relationships accurately. \n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the task, no entities or relationships can be identified from the provided text fragment. The text discusses general human qualities and resilience in the face of hardship without mentioning specific individuals, locations, organizations, or events that can be categorized according to the given entity types.\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
