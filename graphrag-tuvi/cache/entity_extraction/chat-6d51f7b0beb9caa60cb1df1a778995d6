{"result": "Given the provided text and the specified entity types (organization, person, geo, event), the text does not contain clear, explicit references to entities of these types in a manner that allows for detailed extraction based on the instructions. The text appears to discuss astrological or health-related concepts in a language other than English, specifically mentioning aspects related to health and sexual tendencies in astrological houses. Without explicit references to organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events, and considering the language barrier and the context provided, it's challenging to extract entities and relationships as per the given format.\n\nThe text seems to be discussing astrological interpretations, potentially related to health and sexual behavior, but without clear entities like organizations, persons, geographical locations, or specific events mentioned in a way that fits the extraction criteria, no entities or relationships can be accurately identified and formatted according to the instructions provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the instructions and the text provided:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
