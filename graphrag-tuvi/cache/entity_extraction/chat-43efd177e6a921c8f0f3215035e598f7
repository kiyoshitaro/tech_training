Without further context or a more detailed explanation of the terms used (such as \"cung N\u00f4,\" \"cung B\u00e0o,\" \"T\u1eed,\" and \"Ph\u1ee5\"), it's challenging to accurately identify entities as organizations, persons, geos, or events in the conventional sense.\n\nThe text seems to refer to astrological houses or similar concepts (\"cung\") and their interactions or influences, which might be significant in the cultural or astrological context but do not directly translate to the specified entity types without additional interpretation or context.\n\nTherefore, based on the given instructions and without additional context or clarification, it's not possible to provide a meaningful output of entities and relationships as per the examples provided.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
