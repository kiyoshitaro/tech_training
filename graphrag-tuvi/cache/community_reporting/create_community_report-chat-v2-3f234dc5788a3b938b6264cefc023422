This includes a traditional view where women are seen as primarily responsible for reproductive health, childbirth, and fertility issues, emphasizing their role in the continuation of the family lineage and the health of future generations.\n\nMoreover, Ph\u1ee5 N\u1eef are described as having a special moral and psychological stance, with a unique perspective on ethics, community spirit, and the impact they have on the family and society. This perspective acknowledges the complex interplay between their societal roles and the personal sacrifices they may make, such as foregoing their own careers or personal development to support their families. In some contexts, women are portrayed as being subordinate to their husbands, with little to no career aspirations of their own, or if they do have careers, they are still expected to prioritize family needs.\n\nOverall, Ph\u1ee5 N\u1eef represents a multifaceted view of women, highlighting the diverse roles they play and the varied expectations they navigate within the family and society.

This aspect of his character suggests a deviation from traditional patriarchal norms, highlighting a dynamic where the husband's authority or position might be influenced or overshadowed by his wife's familial connections or personal achievements.\n\nOn the other hand, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng also represents the traditional role of husbands, holding a position of authority over their wives, with an expectation for wives to serve them and their families. This traditional view underscores a societal expectation for wives to adhere to their husband's needs and the needs of his family, reinforcing a patriarchal structure within the household.\n\nFurthermore, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng is described as having traits of cowardice and inferiority complex, which are seen as the main causes of domestic discord.
