It is mentioned in a list that suggests an involvement with health-related conditions or practices, indicating that H\u1ed3ng may have positive effects under certain unspecified conditions. However, H\u1ed3ng is also associated with financial loss due to female relationships, hinting at its role as an astrological condition or entity that influences financial stability in the context of relationships with women.\n\nIn addition, H\u1ed3ng is closely associated with \u0110\u00e0o, with several references highlighting their connection. This relationship between H\u1ed3ng and \u0110\u00e0o is indicative of a potential to lead to wealth through beauty, suggesting a cultural belief in the financial luck brought by females. Both entities share characteristics that are best displayed during the day, with their qualities becoming less visible at night due to lack of visibility. This could metaphorically imply that their positive attributes or influences are more pronounced or effective in certain conditions.\n\nFurthermore, H\u1ed3ng and \u0110\u00e0o are mentioned together in contexts that suggest a loss of vibrancy or significance, which could be metaphorical for a person's state. They are also indicated to play roles intertwined with love, care, or professional intimacy, pointing towards a deeper, possibly symbolic or cultural significance in human relationships and social interactions.\n\nLastly, H\u1ed3ng is identified with specific characteristics or influences in astrological texts, reinforcing its role in cultural and astrological practices. The mention of H\u1ed3ng alongside \u0110\u00e0o in various contexts without specific details leaves room for interpretation but consistently points towards an intertwined relationship between the two, affecting wealth, relationships, and personal states, often in relation to the presence or influence of women.\n\nIn summary, H\u1ed3ng, in association with \u0110\u00e0o, emerges as an astrological or cultural entity with implications for health, financial stability, and personal relationships. Its influences are believed to be positive under certain conditions, particularly in relation to beauty and female relationships, although it also carries associations with financial loss and a metaphorical loss of vibrancy or significance.\",7\n291,\"\"\"\u0110\u00c0O\"\"\",\"\u0110\u00e0o is a multifaceted entity that appears to embody both positive and negative aspects within various contexts, possibly related to astrology, personal relationships, and metaphorical interpretations of life situations. \u0110\u00e0o is associated with wealth that can be acquired through women, whether they are wives or lovers, suggesting a beneficial influence under certain conditions. However, this entity is also indicated as a factor leading to financial loss through relationships, hinting at a specific astrological condition or entity that might represent a dual nature in financial matters.\n\nIn some contexts, \u0110\u00e0o is listed among names that could indicate a person involved in health or medical conditions, suggesting a possible connection to the well-being of individuals. It is mentioned as a star that is beneficial under certain conditions, although the specifics are not detailed, which could imply an astrological significance that impacts various aspects of life differently depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe qualities of \u0110\u00e0o are best appreciated during the day, especially at dawn when flowers bloom, which may symbolize a moment of beauty and renewal that \u0110\u00e0o brings. This entity is involved with others in a way that can lead to wealth through beauty, yet it is also suggested that \u0110\u00e0o can lead to losses, potentially in gambling or other ventures, and may imply a tendency towards being exploited or spending on appearances.\n\n\u0110\u00e0o's role is nuanced, representing loved ones or individuals in professions of intimacy, and is mentioned in the context of marital issues, specifically relating to infidelity. This suggests that \u0110\u00e0o's influence extends into personal relationships, where it can have both enriching and detrimental effects.\n\nFurthermore, \u0110\u00e0o is noted for its particular nature within the astrological framework being discussed, indicating a complex role that may affect various aspects of life, from financial to personal relationships. The mention of \u0110\u00e0o in the context of losing flavor and essence could be metaphorical for a person's situation or condition, reflecting the transient and sometimes challenging influence of \u0110\u00e0o.\n\nIn summary, \u0110\u00e0o represents a complex entity or concept that embodies dualities of wealth and loss, beauty and decay, and personal intimacy and infidelity. Its influence is seen in astrological terms, personal relationships, and metaphorical interpretations of life's conditions, making it a significant yet ambiguous presence in the contexts mentioned.\",7\n695,\"\"\"SONG HAO\"\"\",\"Song Hao is a multifaceted entity that encompasses both astrological or metaphysical concepts and possibly a physical location, deeply intertwined with personal health, wealth, and broader life circumstances. It appears to be a critical astrological condition or star that significantly impacts an individual's life, particularly in areas related to health, financial stability, and personal relationships. Song Hao is closely associated with Thi\u00ean Tr\u00f9, sharing a tendency towards indulgence in eating and drinking, which suggests a cultural or astrological context where spending habits are influenced by broader cosmic or metaphysical conditions.\n\nThe concept of Song Hao is linked with a series of negative outcomes or challenges. It is indicated to bring about losses, often in the context of gambling or financial ventures, suggesting a streak of bad luck or a predisposition towards unfavorable outcomes. Furthermore, Song Hao is connected with difficult childbirth or nurturing challenges, symbolizing a condition that causes significant distress during pregnancy or childbirth, leading to complications that require extensive care and effort.\n\nIn the realm of personal relationships, Song Hao is mentioned as a factor in financial exploitation, where personal connections are leveraged for monetary gain, often to the detriment of one party. This exploitation extends to broader social interactions, where Song Hao is associated with situations or events leading to an official's vanity, loss of authority, damage to reputation, and failure. Such circumstances result in incompatibility with others and the assignment of menial tasks, highlighting a profound impact on personal and professional life.\n\nSong Hao is also referred to as a location, which could either be a literal place relevant to the narratives in which it is mentioned or a metaphorical space within a cultural or astrological framework. This duality suggests that Song Hao's influence spans both tangible and intangible realms, affecting individuals through both direct interaction with a physical space and the indirect influence of astrological conditions.\n\nMoreover, Song Hao is associated with repeated offenses and imprisonment, indicating a pattern of behavior or a condition that leads to legal or social repercussions. This aspect, coupled with its involvement in change and personal affairs, underscores the complex role Song Hao plays in shaping the trajectory of an individual's life, encompassing both the physical and metaphysical, the personal and the communal, and the internal and external factors that influence human experience.\",3\n687,\"\"\"HO\u00c1 L\u1ed8C\"\"\",\"Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c is characterized as a figure embodying straightforwardness, honesty, and legitimate wealth, setting itself apart from L\u1ed9c T\u00f4n by being less greedy and more ethically competitive. Despite comparisons suggesting Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c's actions or decisions might be considered inferior to L\u1ed9c T\u00f4n's, Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c is also described in astrological terms as an event or condition equating to L\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n, implying a significant impact on one's financial status. This character is known for generosity and an ability to enjoy life, willing to spend money and indulge in pleasures, contrasting with a frugal or overly cautious demeanor. \n\nIn terms of lifestyle, Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c is noted for a more refined or delicate approach to food, lacking the robust eating habits of laborers, which suggests a connoisseur's appreciation for good food. This is further emphasized by its specific relation to the enjoyment of food, fully realized when combined with Thi\u00ean Tr\u00f9, indicating a discerning palate. However, Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c is considered less generous than Nh\u1ecb Hao, highlighting a contrast in their personalities or approaches to business and leisure activities.\n\nHo\u00e0 L\u1ed9c is part of a group that could become wealthy through the influence of beauty, often mentioned in contexts suggesting wealth and prosperity, or as a concept symbolizing financial success. This character is associated with the potential for wealth accumulation through beauty or the favor of women, and not necessarily generating income or business by oneself but possibly receiving income from others. This comprehensive portrayal of Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c depicts a complex character with a blend of ethical competitiveness, generosity, and a refined lifestyle, potentially influenced by external factors such as beauty and relationships, leading to financial success.\",9\n425,\"\"\"L\u1ed8C T\u1ed4N\"\"\",\"L\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n is a multifaceted entity characterized by a blend of talent, organizational prowess, and the ability to adapt and innovate according to circumstances. Within the Chinese conceptual framework, L\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n is possibly identified as a figure or entity associated with both prosperity and loss, suggesting a complex role in influencing the development or suppression of certain tendencies or characteristics. This entity is deeply involved in the real estate business, where its activities span lending money for profit, renting out properties, and generating rental income, indicating a strong foundation in financial management, particularly in administrative management and banking. L\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n's assets are described as relatively immobile, with capital heavily invested in real estate ventures.\n\nIn addition to its business acumen, L\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n is mentioned in astrological or traditional contexts, associated with specific configurations that affect one's fortune, including the slow development of love and moderated expression of physiological desires, which also implies a potential for loneliness in love. This entity is portrayed as cautious and calculating, perhaps more so than Ho\u00e1 L\u1ed9c, with whom it is often mentioned in connection to wealth accumulation. This comparison suggests a careful approach to finances and resources, possibly indicating frugality or selfishness. The relationship with Ho\u00e1 L\u1ed9c also hints at a connection to beauty or the favor of women as pathways to wealth accumulation.\n\nL\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n is described in some narratives as an event that significantly impacts family lines, either through reducing the number of children by two or leading to unusual circumstances that could end a lineage. This aspect, combined with its association with longevity through wealth and the potential for contributing to wealth when combined with Thi\u00ean M\u00e3, paints a picture of an entity or concept deeply intertwined with the fortunes and misfortunes of individuals and families.\n\nIn summary, L\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n embodies a complex interplay between prosperity and loss, with a significant influence on financial and familial outcomes. Its role spans from the practical realms of real estate and financial management to the more esoteric fields of astrology and traditional practices, making it a pivotal figure or concept in discussions of wealth, love, and lineage continuity.\",6\n1156,\"\"\"B\u1ec6NH S\u1ea2N THAI, \u0110AU D\u1ea0 CON, KH\u00d3 \u0110\u1eba\"\"\",\"\"\"Describes conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth difficulties, highlighting significant health events.\"\"\",2\n1155,\"\"\"B\u1ec6NH TI\u1ec2U S\u1ea2N, H\u1eacU S\u1ea2N\"\"\",\"\"\"Refers to conditions related to postpartum health issues, indicating specific health events.\"\"\",2\n1057,\"\"\"DI S\u1ea2N\"\"\",\"\"\"Di s\u1ea3n refers to the inheritance that can be negatively affected by debts left by parents or not received at all, or that may be significantly diminished.\"\"\",3\n1050,\"\"\"M\u1ea0NH TH\u1eea\u01a0NG QU\u00c2N\"\"\",\"M\u1ea1nh Th\u01b0\u1eddng Qu\u00e2n is characterized as a generous and philanthropic individual, known for daring to donate and offer gifts.
