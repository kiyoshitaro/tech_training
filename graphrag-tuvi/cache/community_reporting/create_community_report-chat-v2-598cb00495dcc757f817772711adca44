It is known to occur at Ty H\u1ed3i, where it accelerates and magnifies power, albeit possibly not enduringly. This event or influence is capable of negatively impacting various aspects of life, including honor (Quy\u1ec1n), wealth (L\u1ed9c), and academic success (Khoa), especially noted within the context of Tam Ho\u00e0. Furthermore, Kh\u00f4ng Ki\u1ebfp is associated with adverse conditions leading to robbery, assault, and extortion, highlighting its potential for bringing misfortune or disadvantage. Despite these negative connotations, it also has a dual nature that can be useful in military strategy, enhancing courage in combat situations, and boosting martial prowess, suggesting its value in certain contexts.\n\nKh\u00f4ng Ki\u1ebfp's influence is significantly stronger when aligned with other entities, indicating its role in the broader cosmic or astrological systems. It is implicated in causing temporary separation or challenges in relationships, further emphasizing its impact on personal life. Additionally, its involvement in the quick buying and selling of real estate points to a role in the property market, affecting economic activities.\n\nThe descriptions suggest that Kh\u00f4ng Ki\u1ebfp could be an organization or a concept within a specific system, potentially related to balancing disadvantages. It is also mentioned in contexts that imply it could be a location or a broader concept related to astrology or fate, though its exact nature remains somewhat ambiguous without additional context. Moreover, Kh\u00f4ng Ki\u1ebfp represents a type of event or situation that could indicate disastrous or unfortunate occurrences, particularly noted in the context of aviation accidents or electrical hazards.\n\nIn summary, Kh\u00f4ng Ki\u1ebfp embodies a paradoxical entity within astrological or geomantic traditions, capable of both harm and benefit. Its influence spans from personal aspects such as wealth, honor, and relationships to broader societal impacts like military strategy and real estate dynamics. Despite its potential for causing misfortune, its strategic advantages in certain contexts cannot be overlooked, making it a complex figure in the realms it influences.\",11\n1026,\"\"\"CUNG \u0110I\u1ec2N\"\"\",\"Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n is a multifaceted entity that encompasses a wide range of assets and significances within its scope. It is not only associated with traditional agricultural assets such as homes and land but also extends to modern industrial and material conveniences. These include enterprises, processed products, crops, minerals, and machinery related to real estate. This broad spectrum of assets indicates that Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n plays a significant role in both the agricultural and industrial sectors, bridging the gap between traditional and modern practices.\n\nMoreover, Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n holds a cultural or possibly astrological significance in marital decisions, suggesting that it is a place where people consider the prospects of marriage. This aspect highlights its importance in the social and cultural fabric of the community, serving as a venue or concept where important life decisions are contemplated.\n\nIn the realm of real estate, Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n is mentioned as a location associated with property dealings, indicating its relevance in the housing and land market. This is further emphasized by references to governmental grants, where material comforts such as land or housing provided by the government are bestowed, possibly as part of social welfare or support programs.\n\nAdditionally, Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n might also refer to a place or concept related to education, learning, or moral lessons within a cultural or astrological framework. This suggests that beyond its material and social significances, Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n could embody educational or ethical values, contributing to the moral or intellectual development of individuals.\n\nHowever, Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n is also associated with a state of poverty in terms of tangible assets like home, garden, vehicles, crops, workshops, and production items. This paradoxical situation, where individuals might have money but lack the resources to acquire real estate, underscores the complex nature of Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n's significance. It reflects the challenges and disparities in accessing material wealth and real estate, despite the presence of financial assets.\n\nIn summary, Cung \u0110i\u1ec7n is a complex entity that integrates agricultural, industrial, social, cultural, educational, and economic dimensions. It plays a pivotal role in various aspects of life, from property dealings and governmental support to marriage considerations and educational values, while also highlighting the challenges of material acquisition and the disparities in wealth distribution.\",2\n793,\"\"\"H\u1eceA L\u0128NH\"\"\",\"\"\"H\u1ecfa L\u0129nh is described as a 's\u00e1t t\u1ec9nh, hung t\u1ec9nh' indicating a strong, daring character, possibly a warrior or military figure.\"\"\",2\n792,\"\"\"KINH \u0110\u00c0\"\"\",\"\"\"Kinh \u0110\u00e0 is identified alongside Kh\u00f4ng Ki\u1ebfp and H\u1ecfa L\u0129nh as having a strong, bold nature, likely a figure related to military or martial themes.\"\"\",2\n717,\"\"\"MILITARY STRATEGY\"\"\",,1\n364,\"\"\"QUY\u1ec0N\"\"\",\"Quy\u1ec1n, within the context of Quan l\u1ed9c, signifies a place or an important concept that holds a role or significance in this aspect.
