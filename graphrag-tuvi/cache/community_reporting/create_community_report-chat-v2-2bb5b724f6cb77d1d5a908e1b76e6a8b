It plays a significant organizational role in a person's life, affecting their ability to progress, rely on others, and achieve success in educational, literary, and professional fields. Quan is associated with positions of power, which can sometimes be unstable, leading to difficulties, hostilities, and even violent outcomes. Despite these challenges, Quan is characterized by a good nature, often helping individuals use their assets for philanthropic activities and influencing their external happiness and success in life.\n\nQuan is identified as one of the seven key aspects within an astrological or traditional framework, suggesting its relevance to authority, social status, and the occupational environment. It is closely related to other astrological aspects such as Th\u00e2n, T\u1eed - Vi, and M\u1ec7nh, indicating its importance in the trends of stars and its impact on the professional life and relationships within professional settings. This concept also symbolizes the realm where H\u00f3a Ky's influence of gossip and slander manifests, affecting N\u00f4's interactions within these environments.\n\nMoreover, Quan is described as a place or position of power, associated with political and administrative professions. It represents individuals who have succeeded in these areas, highlighting a specific societal role. However, it is also mentioned as a location associated with political or bureaucratic instability, characterized by dissatisfaction and rivalry among officials. This suggests that Quan can be both a concept and a place related to authority or officialdom, reflecting its dual nature in certain interpretations.\n\nIn summary, Quan encapsulates the essence of authority and career achievements within Vietnamese astrology and culture. It influences a person's professional life, social status, and the ability to achieve external happiness, while also being associated with the challenges and instabilities that come with positions of power.\",12\n67,\"\"\"N\u00d4\"\"\",\"N\u00f4 is conceptualized as an entity deeply intertwined with the dynamics of social and professional relationships, encompassing a broad spectrum of interactions from friends and servants to subordinates and personal relations. It plays a significant organizational role within external environments, highlighting its importance in managing and influencing those close to an individual, such as friends, servants, and subordinates. This role is not limited to mere management but extends to shaping the nature of these relationships, often influenced by societal norms (Di) and occupational contexts (Quan).\n\nMoreover, N\u00f4 is associated with the concept of \"\"H\u00f2a quy\u1ec1n,\"\" which delves into the nuanced dynamics of fear and respect within personal relationships. This aspect is particularly emphasized in the context of marital or romantic relationships, where it explores the balance of power and the mutual respect or fear that can exist between partners, such as a husband's fear or respect towards his wife or lover.\n\nN\u00f4 also embodies an indirect influence or represents a phase of opportunity, suggesting its role extends beyond the immediate and tangible into the realm of potential and possibility within human interactions. This multifaceted entity, therefore, encapsulates the complexity of human relationships, governed by a mix of emotional, societal, and professional factors, making it a pivotal concept in understanding the interplay between individuals and their wider social and occupational networks.\",4\n815,\"\"\"V\u0102N TINH\"\"\",\"V\u0103n Tinh refers to a concept in Vietnamese astrology that signifies the importance of literary and academic achievements in a person's life.
