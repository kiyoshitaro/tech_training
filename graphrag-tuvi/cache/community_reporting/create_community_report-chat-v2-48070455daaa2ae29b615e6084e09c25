It is not a geographical location but an astrological 'house' or domain that significantly influences an individual's life, particularly in terms of blessings and fortune inherited from previous lives, which affect current educational and literary accomplishments, as well as the overall quality and longevity of life. Cung Ph\u00fac complements Cung T\u1eed, playing a crucial role in determining the conditions related to children's misfortunes or characteristics, and while it is influential, its effects are considered less direct compared to other aspects such as M\u1ec7nh (Destiny) and Th\u00e2n (Body).\n\nThis astrological house signifies not only the inherent fortune determined by stars in the Blessing Palace but also fortune combined from other aspects like wealth, social happiness, and external society. It is described as having a multifaceted influence, where adversities within it can lead to significant misfortunes, affecting wealth, era, and family values. Despite its wide-ranging influence, Cung Ph\u00fac is considered to have a limited ability to avert or mitigate disasters, influencing only certain aspects of a situation rather than having a comprehensive impact.\n\nCung Ph\u00fac is deemed an extremely important aspect related to happiness in the contexts of society, family, and livelihood, described as having a solid and concise human foundation due to its construction and relationships with three other aspects: society (Di), family (Phu Th\u00ea), and livelihood (T\u00e0i). It does not directly determine profession but plays a role in conjunction with other elements in determining a person's career path, especially when aligned with elements from Cung Quan, M\u1ec7nh, Th\u00e2n, or T\u00e0i.\n\nFurthermore, Cung Ph\u00fac is associated with wealth or material happiness, closely linked with other aspects of life such as social happiness and family happiness. It represents the lineage, fertility status, and overall destiny of a family or bloodline, highlighting its influence on the aspect of Cung T\u1eed. It is also mentioned as one of the areas in the T\u1eed-Vi system related to inherited wealth from ancestors, emphasizing its significance in astrological assessments related to fortune and misfortune.\n\nIn summary, Cung Ph\u00fac, within the discipline of Khoa T\u1eed-Vi, deals with lineage, the condition of having many or few children in a family or bloodline, and the\",20\n1310,\"\"\"CUNG M\u1ec6NH TH\u00c2N\"\"\",\"Cung M\u1ec7nh Th\u00e2n is an astrological concept in Vietnamese astrology that plays a significant role in determining an individual's destiny, life path, and physical body.

It is deeply intertwined with the principles of Feng Shui and traditional Chinese beliefs, including the forces of \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng (Yin and Yang) and Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh (the Five Elements), indicating its comprehensive impact on a person's life force and energy.\n\nCung M\u1ec7nh is associated with various aspects of an individual's life, including personality traits, behaviors, and the spiritual or personal journey. It is described as having a direct impact on one's livelihood, indirectly influencing future prosperity and challenges, and is particularly important for interpretations related to life and destiny. This astrological house is influenced by three aspects: Di (circumstances), Quan (profession), and T\u00e0i (wealth), which collectively determine a person's fate.

It is not a geographical entity but an astrological house, often referred to as the \"\"Body Palace\"\" or the house related to the self, body, and personal identity. This concept is deeply intertwined with personal development, health, and physical matters, highlighting its role in determining personal destiny, career path, and stability in life.\n\nCung Th\u00e2n is associated with personal identity or the physical self and has implications for moral or social behavior, potentially within an astrological or cultural framework. It is considered a man-made asset, indicating wealth or assets acquired in one's lifetime, which signals future inheritance for descendants. This phase in life is crucial for establishing one's profession, living independently, and is closely related to Cung T\u00e0i (Wealth) and Cung \u0110i\u1ec1n (Fields), indicating areas concerning livelihood and personal development.\n\nThe concept is constructed by three elements: Di, Quan, T\u00e0i, similar to Cung M\u1ec7nh but focuses on the time after the age of 30, marking a true phase of wealth creation. It is always in harmony with Cung M\u1ec7nh, indicating a principle of balance and non-contradiction in personal astrology. Cung Th\u00e2n is described as being directly affected by circumstances, profession, and financial status, and is part of a trio with Cung Ph\u00fac and Cung M\u1ec7nh, suggesting its importance in determining personal destiny or spiritual path.\n\nCung Th\u00e2n is emphasized as crucial for establishing one's career or reputation, especially during this specific period in life. A good Cung Th\u00e2n implies a stable career with less job change, while a bad one suggests frequent career shifts and struggles. It is highlighted as a significant aspect impacting an individual's life, especially in relation to marriage, adulthood, and the establishment of a career or public reputation.\n\nIn summary, Cung Th\u00e2n represents a pivotal astrological concept in Vietnamese astrology that affects the latter part of an individual's life, focusing on personal health, physical matters, and the establishment of a stable career and wealth creation.

It is associated with both the positive aspects of marital relationships, such as happiness and support in personal and professional development, and the challenges that can arise, including marital discord and challenges within the family.
