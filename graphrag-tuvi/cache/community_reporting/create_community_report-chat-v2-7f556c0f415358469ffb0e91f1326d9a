On one hand, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng is depicted as respecting or fearing his wife due to her superior family background or personal status, which indicates a dependency on his wife's side of the family for support and possibly status. This aspect of his character suggests a deviation from traditional patriarchal norms, highlighting a dynamic where the husband's authority or position might be influenced or overshadowed by his wife's familial connections or personal achievements.\n\nOn the other hand, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng also represents the traditional role of husbands, holding a position of authority over their wives, with an expectation for wives to serve them and their families. This traditional view underscores a societal expectation for wives to adhere to their husband's needs and the needs of his family, reinforcing a patriarchal structure within the household.\n\nFurthermore, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng is described as having traits of cowardice and inferiority complex, which are seen as the main causes of domestic discord. This characterization adds a layer of complexity to the understanding of Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng, suggesting that the issues within the marital relationship may stem from the husband's personal insecurities and perceived inadequacies. This aspect challenges the traditional authoritative role expected of Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng, indicating that the dynamics within these relationships can be significantly affected by the husband's self-perception and behavior.\n\nIn summary, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng is a term that encapsulates the varied and often contradictory roles and characteristics of husbands within the context of marriage and family life. From being dependent on and respectful or fearful of their wives due to the latter's superior status, to embodying traditional patriarchal authority, and grappling with personal insecurities that lead to marital strife, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Ch\u1ed3ng represents a complex figure navigating the expectations and realities of marital roles.\",3\n1467,\"\"\"\u0110\u00c0N \u00d4NG\"\"\",\"\"\"\u0110\u00e0n \u00f4ng (men) are mentioned as being influenced by society and, in turn, by women under certain conditions.\"\"\",3\n1465,\"\"\"NG\u01af\u1edcI V\u1ee2\"\"\",\"Ng\u01b0\u1eddi V\u1ee3, or the wife, is portrayed with a complex set of characteristics and societal roles that vary across different contexts.

In modern society, Ng\u01b0\u1eddi V\u1ee3's status has been elevated, particularly in their relationships with their husbands, indicating a shift towards more equal footing within the marital dynamic. However, she is also mentioned as a cause of domestic discord, linked to her strong character and vulnerable position. Contrarily, in Chinese society, the wife's status is depicted as low both within the family and in society at large, with her responsibilities being traditionally confined to being a daughter, a homemaker, and a mother.
