It is known for its rural family life, where science has had limited influence on family planning and agriculture. Vi\u1ec7t Nam has developed its own approach to the study of astrology, particularly Khoa T\u1eed-Vi, which was introduced and further developed by local scholars, differentiating from Trung Hoa (China) by adapting and modifying the original teachings to fit its national characteristics. This includes a unique classification and systematization of constellations, specifically the categorization of the Sun (Nh\u1eadt) and the Moon (Nguy\u1ec7t), and recognizing only 14 chief stars in its astrological or cultural system.\n\nThe country is mentioned alongside China in historical contexts, suggesting comparisons in concepts such as 'Quan l\u1ed9c' (officials being awarded land and wealth), cultural values related to childbirth and the preference for sons, and societal norms that are harsh towards women's conduct and marital history. Despite these similarities, Vi\u1ec7t Nam has its distinct cultural identity and philosophical views, especially in the realm of astrology where it does not rank planets in a specific order and emphasizes the importance of using local time at the place of birth for certain calculations.\n\nFamily discord and the common issues within families are highlighted as cultural or societal aspects, reflecting on the challenges faced in the context of marriages and family life. The influence of social class and circumstances on foreigners, even if born in Vi\u1ec7t Nam, is also noted, indicating the complex interplay of social dynamics.\n\nAstrologically, Vi\u1ec7t Nam is significant for its local beliefs regarding compatibility between zodiac signs and the statistical occurrence of astrological charts, where, statistically, every 73 people share the same chart. This highlights the cultural relevance of astrology, including practices such as classifying stars based on their main characteristics to distinguish between good and bad, strong and weak, and adapting traditional practices for local timekeeping and astrological purposes.\n\nVi\u1ec7t Nam's civilization and morals, often described alongside those of China, showcase its cultural and historical significance. The country's people often do not know their exact time of birth, using natural events or daily activities as references, which further localizes the practice of T\u1eed-Vi astrology.
