This geographical and cultural context is deeply intertwined with the philosophical approach of China, which contrasts with the West by focusing on overarching principles like \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng and emphasizing a unique approach to understanding the universe through intuition and basic observation rather than in-depth scientific inquiry. This cosmic view is not only aimed at guiding human behavior through the lessons of the cosmos but is also reflected in the societal values and ambitions of its citizens, including the concepts of elemental interactions and spatial arrangements in traditional philosophy.\n\nChina's philosophical contributions, particularly during the Song and Qing dynies, have been significant, with a cultural background where gender-biased notions were deeply ingrained. The country is described as having a synthetic approach to phenomena, integrating them through philosophy and using experiments to illuminate events, which contrasts with Western methods. This includes the original source of astrological practices from which Vietnam adapted its own version, highlighting the cultural exchange and adaptation between the two cultures. China's approach to classifying stars into different categories and its societal structure, emphasizing a monarchical and feudal system, further illustrate its rich cultural and historical approach to astronomy and governance.\n\nThe culinary culture of China is highlighted as sophisticated and highly regarded worldwide, emphasizing the geographical and cultural context of discussed medical practices and the importance of longevity and health practices in Chinese culture. The concepts of \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh and the philosophical context of harmony between heaven (Tr\u1eddi) and humanity (Ng\u01b0\u1eddi) through these principles and the Five Elements underscore China's philosophical and cosmological traditions.\n\nChina's historical contribution to the field of astrology, including the classification of stars into the categories of Nam and B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u and the acknowledgment of 19 major stars in its theory, showcases its cultural and astrological beliefs and practices. The country's medical practices during the Song dynasty, its ancient knowledge of physics and chemistry, and its contributions to the understanding of the universe further highlight its historical and geographical significance.\n\nIn summary, Trung Hoa, or China, represents a rich tapestry of cultural, philosophical, and scientific contributions that have significantly influenced not only its own societal values and structures but also those of neighboring regions and beyond. Its approach to life, the universe, and everything in between is marked by a deep integration of philosophical principles, a rich culinary\",30\n244,\"\"\"VI\u1ec6T NAM\"\"\",\"Vi\u1ec7t Nam, a country in Southeast Asia, is rich in cultural, historical, and astrological significance. It is known for its rural family life, where science has had limited influence on family planning and agriculture. Vi\u1ec7t Nam has developed its own approach to the study of astrology, particularly Khoa T\u1eed-Vi, which was introduced and further developed by local scholars, differentiating from Trung Hoa (China) by adapting and modifying the original teachings to fit its national characteristics. This includes a unique classification and systematization of constellations, specifically the categorization of the Sun (Nh\u1eadt) and the Moon (Nguy\u1ec7t), and recognizing only 14 chief stars in its astrological or cultural system.\n\nThe country is mentioned alongside China in historical contexts, suggesting comparisons in concepts such as 'Quan l\u1ed9c' (officials being awarded land and wealth), cultural values related to childbirth and the preference for sons, and societal norms that are harsh towards women's conduct and marital history. Despite these similarities, Vi\u1ec7t Nam has its distinct cultural identity and philosophical views, especially in the realm of astrology where it does not rank planets in a specific order and emphasizes the importance of using local time at the place of birth for certain calculations.\n\nFamily discord and the common issues within families are highlighted as cultural or societal aspects, reflecting on the challenges faced in the context of marriages and family life. The influence of social class and circumstances on foreigners, even if born in Vi\u1ec7t Nam, is also noted, indicating the complex interplay of social dynamics.\n\nAstrologically, Vi\u1ec7t Nam is significant for its local beliefs regarding compatibility between zodiac signs and the statistical occurrence of astrological charts, where, statistically, every 73 people share the same chart. This highlights the cultural relevance of astrology, including practices such as classifying stars based on their main characteristics to distinguish between good and bad, strong and weak, and adapting traditional practices for local timekeeping and astrological purposes.\n\nVi\u1ec7t Nam's civilization and morals, often described alongside those of China, showcase its cultural and historical significance. The country's people often do not know their exact time of birth, using natural events or daily activities as references, which further localizes the practice of T\u1eed-Vi astrology. Additionally, Vi\u1ec7t Nam's geographical and cultural relevance is underscored by changes to time calculation, with its time being one hour ahead of the official and international legal time as of\",21\n428,\"\"\"M\u1ed8C, H\u1eceA, TH\u1ed4, KIM, TH\u1ee6Y\"\"\",\"\"\"M\u1ed9c, H\u1ecfa, Th\u1ed5, Kim, Th\u1ee7y are the Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) in Chinese philosophy, representing different characteristics and are believed to be the fundamental elements of everything in the universe.\"\"\",2\n307,\"\"\"T\u1eec-VI VI\u1ec6T NAM\"\"\",\"T\u1eed-Vi Vi\u1ec7t Nam is a significant entity in the realm of Vietnamese astrology, representing the Vietnamese adaptation of T\u1eed-Vi astrology, a practice deeply rooted in the country's cultural and historical significance.

This adaptation does not strictly differentiate between the original Chinese stars and those added by Vietnam, highlighting its unique approach to astrology. T\u1eed-Vi Vi\u1ec7t Nam is involved in the study of astrology, with a particular focus on the impact of disasters on various aspects of life, indicating its comprehensive role in Vietnamese society.

This societal structure not only highlights the cultural and geographical significance of X\u00e3 H\u1ed9i Trung Hoa but also sheds light on the standards of success that were prevalent during the time. Additionally, the societal structure and cultural norms of China paid specific attention to women's roles and expectations, indicating a comprehensive framework of social order and gender roles within the society.

This suggests that B\u1ec7nh Ph\u00f9 may not only refer to a singular entity but could represent a broader concept or series of events that are astrologically determined. Additionally, B\u1ec7nh Ph\u00f9 is identified as a star or entity within a system, hinting at its possible representation as an astrological or mythological figure. This aligns with the understanding that it could embody more than just a physical or tangible aspect, but also a symbolic or celestial one.\n\nMoreover, B\u1ec7nh Ph\u00f9 is associated with contexts suggesting it could relate to health or disease, specifically mentioning conditions related to illness or swelling. This dual nature of B\u1ec7nh Ph\u00f9, where it is both an astrological concept and a term related to health conditions, showcases its complex role in Chinese culture. It embodies the intertwining of celestial influence with human health and well-being, reflecting the belief in the interconnectedness of cosmic events and physical conditions.
