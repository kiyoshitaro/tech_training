It represents a significant hazard characterized by its inevitability and the widespread impact it has on many people simultaneously, potentially affecting national economies and personal assets. Ki\u1ebfp Kh\u1ed5ng is associated with a fatalistic outlook, often indicating a potential for death through violence or surgical intervention, and symbolizes a period or aspect marked by minimal support and increased obstacles. This concept is also linked to severe diseases and conditions affecting the digestive system.\n\nKi\u1ebfp Kh\u1ed5ng embodies the persona of a majorly unrighteous individual who amasses wealth through the exploitation of the masses and national assets, overshadowing others with actions characterized by taking or aggressive behavior. It is described as an event or condition with serious implications, signaling major, unavoidable disasters with long-term and severe consequences for property owners. These disasters include theft, destruction of personal property, arson, crop destruction, business failures, shipwrecks, and other accidents like bombings, leading to severe losses.\n\nDespite the predominantly negative connotations, Ki\u1ebfp Kh\u1ed5ng is also described in contexts that suggest fluctuating fortunes and achievements, primarily in martial prowess or career, influenced by other factors or entities.
