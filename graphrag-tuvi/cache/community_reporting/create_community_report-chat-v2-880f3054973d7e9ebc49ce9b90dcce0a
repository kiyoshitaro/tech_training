It is mentioned alongside D\u00e2n, highlighting its importance in astrological or cultural studies as presented by Vi\u1ec7t Vi\u1ec7m T\u1eed. M\u00e3o is not just a term used in geomancy for indicating a specific direction or position with implications for a person's life and destiny, but it also plays a crucial role in explaining the rules or effects of Tu\u1ea7n and Tri\u1ec7t. This position is compatible with Tu\u1ea5t, indicating a part of a traditional or astrological compatibility system, and is part of a trio with H\u1ee3i and M\u00f9i, showcasing specific compatibilities in traditional beliefs.\n\nM\u00e3o is described as an astrological position that benefits from the presence of \u0110\u1ea1i Hao, associated with prosperity and the element of wood, and where \u0110\u1ea1i Hao and Ti\u1ec3u Hao indicate wealth. It is also a favorable position for C\u1ef1 M\u00f4n and Thi\u00ean C\u01a1, enhancing financial success and business strategies. Despite some mentions suggesting it could be a geographical location, the consensus is that M\u00e3o is more likely a concept or time period in Vietnamese astrology rather than a geographic location. It is part of the 12 Chi, representing a zodiac sign or symbol in a traditional system linked to cultural or astrological beliefs.\n\nFurthermore, M\u00e3o is referred to in the context of Li\u00eam Trinh's placement, indicating a geographical or astrological significance that influences the behavior or fate of individuals. It is also compatible with D\u1eadu, as part of the Vietnamese zodiac, representing people born in the Year of the Cat (or Rabbit in other cultures), believed to influence the fate of individuals born under or associated with it.

Furthermore, D\u00e2n is associated with the element of Metal in Vietnamese astrology and is linked to Li\u00eam Trinh, indicating its significance or influence in astrological contexts. It is also referred to in discussions about the hypothesis of Vi\u1ec7t Vi\u00eam T\u1eed, suggesting its importance as a location or time period within Vietnamese astrology or culture. Additionally, D\u00e2n is mentioned in the context of compatibility, hinting at its role in astrological interpretations.
