His work significantly advanced the philosophical understanding of various concepts, including the Five Elements (Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh), the dynamics of Yin and Yang, and the theories of Qi (vital force) and Li (principle). Chu Hi discussed the origins of human existence through the concepts of \"\"Kh\u00ed h\u00f3a\"\" (the beginning of human existence without a seed form) and \"\"H\u00ecnh sinh\"\" (the formation of humans and their continuous reproduction), emphasizing the transformation and formation in early cosmological and philosophical theories. He played a crucial role in the development or propagation of the theory known as Duy l\u00fd lu\u1eadn or L\u00fd kh\u00ed, which explores the singular essence and material substance, respectively.\n\nChu Hi's interpretation of \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng (Yin and Yang) and his perspective on the Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh (Five Elements) underscored his belief in the interconnectedness of the universe's elements, suggesting that Water and Fire were the first to emerge, though he also mentioned Earth as the initial element in another instance. This apparent contradiction highlights his nuanced approach to understanding the elements' emergence and their significance in the cosmic order. His work on Qi theory further indicates his significant impact on the philosophical landscape, particularly in how these elements and forces interact within the cosmos and influence human existence.\n\nOverall, Chu Hi's philosophical endeavors encompassed a broad range of topics, from the metaphysical aspects of existence and the natural world's principles to the moral and ethical dimensions of human life, as framed within the context of Neo-Confucian thought. His interpretations and teachings on Li (principle), Qi (vital force), the Yijing (I Ching), and his contributions to the understanding of the Five Elements have left a lasting legacy on Chinese philosophy and beyond.\",10\n183,\"\"\"AM D\u01af\u01a0NG\"\"\",\"Am D\u01b0\u01a1ng is a fundamental concept in traditional Chinese philosophy, representing the dual principle of Yin and Yang.

Am D\u01b0\u01a1ng is not merely a geographical or astrological concept but holds significant monetary and philosophical importance, indicating its deep-rooted influence in various contexts including traditional Chinese cosmology and the Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh and T\u1ee9 T\u01b0\u1ee3ng systems.
