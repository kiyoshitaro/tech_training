It is mentioned in contexts suggesting its effects on personal destiny and is considered a set of mathematical or astrological principles within the Yin and Yang ages.

This term is also associated with the achievement of martial arts prowess during chaotic or tumultuous times, highlighting traits such as boldness, risk-taking, and indomitability.
