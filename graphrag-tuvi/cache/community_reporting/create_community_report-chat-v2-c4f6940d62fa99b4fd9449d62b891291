This includes methods, ranks, traits of the officialdom, and achievements, suggesting a metaphorical or astrological sense where its influence is compared to the light of the moon and sun.\n\nMoreover, Cung Quan is associated with favorable conditions, especially when interacting with entities like H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec3n, and has a decisive role in matters of career or official positions. It is discussed in relation to its impact on the Cung Phu, Th\u00ea, highlighting its importance in astrological or cultural interpretations of marital relationships. Additionally, Cung Quan is mentioned as one of the three aspects related to Cung Ph\u00fac, indicating its significance in the overall structure of happiness and human well-being.\n\nCung Quan is also referenced as a significant location or concept within astrological interpretations, particularly in relation to professional fortunes and misfortunes.

Overall, Cung Quan represents the professional domain within a societal context, related to the profession of the individual and wealth gained from official positions and professions as per the T\u1eed-Vi system, suggesting its pivotal role in determining career-related concerns and influencing professional life.\",16\n298,\"\"\"H\u00d3A QUY\u1ec0N\"\"\",\"H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various aspects of power, authority, and influence, particularly within the realms of astrology, governance, and personal dynamics. It signifies having authority or power, often in a favorable financial context, indicating a role in the governance and distribution of material comforts rather than direct land ownership. This concept is intricately linked to the dynamics of personal relationships and societal structures, suggesting that H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n can lead to a dominant influence of a spouse or lover, potentially causing conflicts within primary marital relationships. It is also associated with traits of pride, arrogance, and a tendency towards authoritarianism, with individuals under its influence not shying away from displaying their self-esteem openly.\n\nHowever, H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n's influence is not uniformly positive. When positioned in the cung N\u00f4, it can lead to suppression by others, indicating that its effects are subject to the nuances of astrological positioning and personal circumstances. This concept also symbolizes transformation or change in power dynamics, suggesting its relevance in times of transition or upheaval.\n\nIn broader terms, H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n represents a concept or entity associated with various domains of power or authority, such as military, literary, or religious, depending on the manner of governance. It embodies traits of self-esteem and self-satisfaction, pointing to a stronger personality.

It is associated with the external society, living environment, or social happiness, emphasizing the general societal domain and the era or external circumstances of social activities. Cung Di is deeply concerned with the circumstances and fate of the individual, particularly in how these external factors influence career paths, talent development, and recognition.\n\nThis term represents external circumstances and fortune, especially in the context of official positions and wealth. It suggests a geographical or metaphorical place related to time and opportunity, indicating its profound impact on an individual's life path and future. Cung Di's influence extends to the determination of professions and is possibly indicative of a geographical or locational aspect, further emphasizing its role in shaping the external social environment or living conditions that impact social happiness.\n\nIn the astrological or cultural context, Cung Di is mentioned alongside Cung N\u00f4, yet it specifically refers to a distinct aspect or area in astrological charts that influences personal attributes or life events. This suggests that Cung Di has a unique place in astrological studies, relating to concerns about fate and destiny and how these external elements contribute to an individual's overall life journey. Through its association with external society and the living environment, Cung Di plays a crucial role in understanding the broader societal influences on personal development and the realization of an individual's potential.\",5\n65,\"\"\"CUNG N\u00d4\"\"\",\"Cung N\u00f4 is a multifaceted concept with deep roots in astrological or cultural significance, particularly within Vietnamese astrology where it is often referred to as the servants' palace.

Cung N\u00f4 is described as a location or segment in astrological readings that is generally seen as unfavorable for H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n, suggesting a place of suppression or challenge. However, it also represents individuals under one's authority, such as teachers, professors, doctors, and business owners, highlighting its association with professions that have a significant impact on society.\n\nThe concept of Cung N\u00f4 extends to the realm of personal relationships, where it is linked to partners, significant others, and secondary partners, indicating its influence on sexual behavior and marital fidelity. It is mentioned in contexts that suggest its relevance to women's polyandry, affectionate nature, and societal roles, particularly in relation to Confucianism and the destiny and social roles of women.

Thi\u1ebfu D\u01b0\u01a1ng is particularly noted for its advantageous positioning during the daytime and when oriented East, indicating a positive influence on educational, financial, and career prospects during these times. However, this positioning may also have adverse effects on mental health, highlighting a complex relationship between its presence and individual well-being.

This positioning suggests that Thi\u1ebfu \u00c2m has a positive influence when situated in the nighttime and facing West, reinforcing the idea that its benefits are maximized under specific conditions.\n\nThi\u1ebfu \u00c2m is frequently mentioned alongside Thi\u1ebfu D\u01b0\u01a1ng and Th\u00e1i \u00c2m, indicating a connection to electrical machinery and technology. This association suggests that Thi\u1ebfu \u00c2m may represent a specific energetic state or condition, possibly related to lesser or diminished yin energy.
