This element, often associated with gold and a range of other metals from iron (Fe) to gold (Au), symbolizes rigidity, persistence, and a synthesis of metallic properties into a single conceptual framework. Kim's significance is deeply embedded in the Five Elements theory (Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh), where it plays a crucial role in the cycles of generating and overcoming, interacting dynamically with the other elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, and Water) to maintain balance in the universe and within individuals.\n\nIn the Vietnamese zodiac and astrology, Kim is linked with specific age groups and animals, including the Rooster (D\u1eadu), Horse (Ng\u1ecd), and Dog (Tu\u1ea5t), indicating its influence on personality traits, life directions, and elemental nature as understood in B\u1ea3n M\u1ec7nh. This association extends to the large cycles of life and the universe, where Kim's presence and influence are acknowledged in philosophical and metaphorical discussions, highlighting its comparison and relationship with other elements and entities.\n\nKim's representation in the Five Elements philosophy and the \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh system underscores its essential qualities of metal, encompassing both the physical and symbolic attributes of metals. This includes not only its physical properties and associations with certain qualities and interactions, particularly in the context of geomancy, but also its metaphorical significance in symbolizing the strength, resilience, and essential nature of the cosmos and human beings. Through these various lenses, Kim's role in Eastern philosophies and astrology is multifaceted, embodying the principles of metal in both the natural world and the spiritual or philosophical realms.\",8\n12,\"\"\"TH\u1ee6Y\"\"\",\"Th\u1ee7y, representing the Water element in Vietnamese philosophy and astrology, plays a crucial role in both the composition and dynamics of the universe and human beings.

This association underscores Th\u1ee7y's significance in determining individual traits and life paths, as it is integral to the concept of B\u1ea3n M\u1ec7nh, indicating a person's elemental nature.\n\nIn the broader context of the Five Elements philosophy, which includes \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh, Th\u1ee7y is essential for the generation and overcoming cycles among the five elements, symbolizing the fluid and adaptable qualities inherent in water. This element is involved in generating wood (M\u1ed9c) and interacts with other elements in a system of relationships that promote balance and transformation. Th\u1ee7y's adaptability and wisdom are highlighted, reflecting the ancient belief in water's containment within the earth and its vital role in the cycle of creation and destruction.\n\nFurthermore, Th\u1ee7y's representation extends to the Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh system, where it is crucial for balancing energies within the philosophy of the five elements.
