It signifies having authority or power, often in a favorable financial context, indicating a role in the governance and distribution of material comforts rather than direct land ownership. This concept is intricately linked to the dynamics of personal relationships and societal structures, suggesting that H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n can lead to a dominant influence of a spouse or lover, potentially causing conflicts within primary marital relationships. It is also associated with traits of pride, arrogance, and a tendency towards authoritarianism, with individuals under its influence not shying away from displaying their self-esteem openly.\n\nHowever, H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n's influence is not uniformly positive. When positioned in the cung N\u00f4, it can lead to suppression by others, indicating that its effects are subject to the nuances of astrological positioning and personal circumstances. This concept also symbolizes transformation or change in power dynamics, suggesting its relevance in times of transition or upheaval.\n\nIn broader terms, H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n represents a concept or entity associated with various domains of power or authority, such as military, literary, or religious, depending on the manner of governance. It embodies traits of self-esteem and self-satisfaction, pointing to a stronger personality.

Cung N\u00f4 is described as a location or segment in astrological readings that is generally seen as unfavorable for H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n, suggesting a place of suppression or challenge. However, it also represents individuals under one's authority, such as teachers, professors, doctors, and business owners, highlighting its association with professions that have a significant impact on society.\n\nThe concept of Cung N\u00f4 extends to the realm of personal relationships, where it is linked to partners, significant others, and secondary partners, indicating its influence on sexual behavior and marital fidelity. It is mentioned in contexts that suggest its relevance to women's polyandry, affectionate nature, and societal roles, particularly in relation to Confucianism and the destiny and social roles of women. Furthermore, Cung N\u00f4 is associated with external marital status, familial, and childbearing aspects, underscoring its importance in discussions related to marital relationships and childbearing.\n\nCung N\u00f4's significance is also seen in its metaphorical or astrological representation of the reasons behind certain social behaviors and traditions, including those related to service, assistance, and the personal domain within external environments.
