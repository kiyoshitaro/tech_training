It integrates astrology, philosophy, and elements of traditional Chinese medicine, utilizing the principles of Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh (the Five Elements) and \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng (Yin and Yang) to offer detailed interpretations of human fate, characteristics, and the dynamics of the universe. This astrological practice is significant in Vietnamese astrology for its comprehensive analysis of individual destinies and character based on the positions of celestial bodies at birth, influencing various aspects of life including wealth, nobility, health, personality, career, and longevity.\n\nT\u1eed-Vi is considered one of the most significant stars in Vietnamese astrology, associated with wealth, nobility, and blessings. It incorporates the analysis of 12 houses and stars, focusing on the dynamics and interactions among them. The system is known for its complexity, requiring not only theoretical knowledge but also practical experience for accurate interpretation. T\u1eed-Vi is described as having a neutral character, with outcomes depending on its companions in the astrological chart. It acknowledges the significance of sexuality, illustrating a deep-rooted cultural understanding of sexual dynamics from 10 centuries ago.\n\nThe practice does not discriminate among individuals or social classes, embodying a spirit of humanism and universality. It views humans and life with an objective lens, recognizing both good and bad aspects without discrimination. T\u1eed-Vi is also associated with geomancy, accepting it as a fundamental principle inseparable from its research object and methodology. It is described as a discipline that does not apply to the deceased or those who have detached from worldly affairs, focusing instead on the living and their engagement with the world.\n\nT\u1eed-Vi's theoretical framework is represented by a chart divided into two main areas, the '\u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n' and 'thi\u00ean b\u00e0n', further divided into 12 houses representing various aspects of life and human activities. It is referred to as an emperor star, signifying wealth, nobility, longevity, fortune, and goodness, and is associated with earning money easily, especially when supported by Th\u1ea5t S\u00e1t but can be weakened by Ph\u00e1 Qu\u00e2n.
