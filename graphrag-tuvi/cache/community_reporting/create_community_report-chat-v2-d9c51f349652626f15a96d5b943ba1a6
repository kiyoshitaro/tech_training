Its medical relevance is further emphasized through its association with electrical machinery and devices that use electricity.\n\nIn astrological interpretations, Th\u00e1i \u00c2m is beneficial when located in the nighttime sector and facing West, associated with the moon's position, suggesting specific influences based on temporal contexts. This placement is considered auspicious for academics, wealth, and career success, though it may have detrimental effects on mental health. Th\u00e1i \u00c2m is characterized by a large, slightly tall stature, fair skin, a square and full face, and bright, beautiful eyes, embodying charm, affection, and sentimentality.

Its astrological context includes a focus on its diminished state, \"\"h\u00e3m,\"\" which has specific implications in analysis, and it is often associated with femininity and potentially negative traits when combined with certain astrological positions. Despite this, Th\u00e1i \u00c2m is also noted for its intuitive intelligence, contrasting with Th\u00e1i D\u01b0\u01a1ng's attributes, and represents individuals who live, reason, and act according to their emotions, often associated with poets.\n\nTh\u00e1i \u00c2m is identified as one of the six stars in the Big Dipper, holding significance in astrology and cultural folklore. It is mentioned alongside Th\u00e1i D\u01b0\u01a1ng, possibly representing a contrasting or complementary concept, symbolizing negative or passive energy. Its importance is also highlighted in the analysis of parental longevity and marital harmony, indicating a positive influence in a male's chart.

Th\u00e1i D\u01b0\u01a1ng's influence is particularly noted in astrological readings, where it is favored under certain conditions, such as being in the same house as Tham Lang or located in M\u00e3o, indicating its importance in determining personal outcomes and its association with academic achievement, intelligence, talent, and morality.\n\nTh\u00e1i D\u01b0\u01a1ng is characterized by better attributes than Th\u00e1i \u00c2m, aligning with Yang energy and preferring daytime, which reflects its classification within a system of stars or geographical categorization in Vietnam as 'nam \u0111\u1ea9u'. It is described as one of two prominent stars, associated with intelligence, quick assimilation, and a deep understanding of issues, representing specific concepts or elements related to time of day or astrological beliefs. This star is also discussed in the context of astrological phenomena, likely representing solar influences and symbolizing positive or active energy.
