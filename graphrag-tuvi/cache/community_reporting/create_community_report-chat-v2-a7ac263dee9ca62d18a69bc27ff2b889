It is recognized within Vietnamese astrology for its role in predicting or determining the gender of unborn children, closely associated with Khao T\u1eed-Vi's method. In traditional Chinese astronomy, B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u refers to a specific system or constellation, often linked with the Big Dipper or the North Star, highlighting its astronomical significance. This entity is intricately connected with the birth of female children, as per the traditional astrological beliefs, and is portrayed as a deity or mythological figure akin to a fate deity, influencing human lives and shaping destinies in ancient narratives.\n\nB\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u, along with Nam \u0110\u1ea9u, forms a celestial dichotomy, representing a group of stars that embody less dynamic aspects when compared together, suggesting a balance within the celestial hemisphere. This balance is further emphasized in ancient Chinese astronomy, where B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u is seen as one half of the celestial hemisphere division, underscoring its importance in astrological classifications and its role in influencing gender ratios. Specifically, B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u is associated with the birth of girls and represents female elements in astrology, linked to specific stars and indicating a predominance of females.

This classification underscores its association with certain stars and its part in a broader system divided by ancient Chinese astronomy.\n\nIn the context of Vietnamese astrology, Nam \u0110\u1ea9u is utilized to predict or determine the gender of unborn children, following the method established by Khao T\u1eed-Vi. This practice underscores the belief in Nam \u0110\u1ea9u's influence over gender determination, further emphasizing its connection to the birth of boys and the representation of male elements within astrological beliefs. Nam \u0110\u1ea9u's dynamic interaction with other stars, particularly its enhanced meaning when combined with them over B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u, suggests a complex interplay that enhances its significance. This group of stars is believed to have not only implications on gender ratios, suggesting a counterpart or complementary celestial role to B\u1eafc \u0111\u1ea9u but also an impact on life events such as marriage, where it is implied to have a delaying effect.\n\nOverall, Nam \u0110\u1ea9u represents a pivotal concept in astrology, associated with the predominance of males and the birth of boys, reflecting its deep-rooted significance in both determining gender and influencing life's outcomes according to astrological and traditional beliefs.\",7\n1133,\"\"\"CUNG T\u1eec\"\"\",\"Cung T\u1eed is a multifaceted term deeply rooted in astrological and cultural traditions, primarily associated with aspects of family, offspring, and the cycles of life and death.

It reflects situations of infertility, emphasizing its significance in the context of family and progeny. This aspect is further clarified as Cung T\u1eed specifically influences the situation of infertility more distinctly than other aspects.\n\nCung T\u1eed's astrological implications are vast, relating to children or descendants within an astrological chart and playing a significant role in determining the conditions related to children's characteristics or misfortunes.
