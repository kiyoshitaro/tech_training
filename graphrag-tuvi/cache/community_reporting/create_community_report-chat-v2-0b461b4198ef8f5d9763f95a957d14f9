It is described as a star, suggesting its importance in astrological or cultural contexts, and is associated with the element Th\u1ee7y, indicating its characteristic influence in astrology. Ph\u00e1 Qu\u00e2n is known for discussing the nature of jealousy as destructive, aiming for swift retaliation through quick and strong actions, sometimes cruelly, similar to Tham Lang. This entity symbolizes a disruptive or transformative force in an individual's life, potentially causing disruptions or challenges in marital life and indicating a significant, possibly negative, astrological interpretation.\n\nPh\u00e1 Qu\u00e2n is associated with T\u1eed-Vi and other celestial entities, suggesting a role in astrological interpretations, including financial struggles but eventual prosperity, indicating a transformative financial influence.

Physically, Ph\u00e1 Qu\u00e2n is described as a large person with a medium to average height, pink skin, a full face, prominent eyes, and sparse eyebrows.\n\nThis astrological entity is also described as extremely greedy, especially in D\u1ea7n, Th\u00e2n, H\u1ee3i locations, associated with unethical profit-making activities. Its malevolent nature often harms others without remorse, associated with destructive and rebellious behavior. Wealth comes quickly and easily through risk-taking and boldness to those influenced by Ph\u00e1 Qu\u00e2n, but this wealth is also fragile due to the risky nature of its acquisition.\n\nPh\u00e1 Qu\u00e2n's astrological event or condition is noted for its unfavorable outcomes in specific situations, suggesting a significant role or attribute in the astrological or cultural context. It influences wealth or poverty and is mentioned as an event associated with conflict or struggle, particularly in the context of heritage and financial challenges.
