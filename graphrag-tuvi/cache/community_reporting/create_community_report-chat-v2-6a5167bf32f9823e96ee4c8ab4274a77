It is primarily associated with the star sign that signifies beginnings, such as the birth of a child or the start of new ventures, embodying the potential for development and the inception of life. Thai is intricately linked to astrological beliefs, suggesting its significant role in matters of love, marriage, and sexual relationships, indicating strong sexual energy and the act of sexual intercourse itself.\n\nMoreover, Thai is deeply entwined with the concepts of pregnancy and fertility, referring to the fetus or womb and highlighting its importance in obstetrics. It represents the physical and sexual aspects of life, including the act of conception and the potential outcomes of pregnancy, such as miscarriage, sudden infant death, or abnormal fetal development. These associations suggest a broader understanding of Thai as a symbol of life's cyclical nature, from conception to birth, and the challenges that may arise in these stages.\n\nIn addition to its physiological meanings, Thai carries implications for human behavior, particularly in terms of passion, lustful behavior, and the societal or personal events related to birth and paternity, including having children out of wedlock. It is mentioned alongside other stars in Vietnamese astrology, each with specific characteristics, further emphasizing its role within this astrological framework. Thai is also paired with Thi\u00ean Ri\u00eau, reinforcing its association with fertility and procreation.\n\nThai's significance extends beyond the personal to encompass a role within the framework of Quan l\u1ed9c, indicating its importance in a broader conceptual or geographical context, though the specific nature of this role remains less clearly defined. Despite the varied and sometimes adverse events associated with Thai in astrology, such as risks related to pregnancy, its overarching symbolism is one of beginnings, potential for development, and the profound impact of birth and fertility on human life and relationships.\",12\n871,\"\"\"QUAN \u0110\u1edaI\"\"\",\"Quan \u0110\u1edbi is a term with multifaceted significance, deeply embedded in astrological, cultural, and traditional contexts. It is primarily associated with sudden, unnatural death, often mentioned in discussions that highlight its astrological or geographical importance. Quan \u0110\u1edbi's mention alongside 'Thai' indicates a risk of miscarriage or sudden infant death, underscoring its connection to adverse outcomes or challenges related to pregnancy. This entity is noted for its involvement in aiding harmful effects, which suggests a direct impact on the severity of situations, particularly those leading to untimely or sudden death without preceding illness.\n\nFurthermore, Quan \u0110\u1edbi's role in astrological discussions points to its importance in astrological or cultural beliefs, indicating that its influence is considered significant in determining the fate or outcomes of certain events. In addition to its ominous associations, Quan \u0110\u1edbi is also described as a belt symbolizing office and authority, traditionally worn by high-ranking officials. This aspect of Quan \u0110\u1edbi highlights a historical or traditional significance, possibly linking its ominous associations with positions of power or authority.\n\nIn summary, Quan \u0110\u1edbi embodies a complex symbol within cultural and astrological discussions, representing both the power and authority of high-ranking officials and the darker aspects of sudden, unnatural deaths, particularly in the context of pregnancy and infant mortality. Its significance spans from contributing to the severity of adverse situations to being an emblem of status and authority.\",3\n1239,\"\"\"\u0110\u00c0O RI\u00caU\"\"\",\"\u0110\u00e0o Ri\u1ec1u is depicted in ancient texts as having a strong sexual desire and promiscuity, characterized by a tendency for a woman to engage in sexual activities immediately after her husband leaves.

On a more symbolic or astrological level, KH\u1ed0C is also mentioned in the context of difficult childbirth or nurturing challenges. This suggests that KH\u1ed0C may represent an element or influence that is considered during times of reproductive difficulties or in the care and raising of children.
