This star is also associated with Kim \u0111\u1edbi H\u1ecfa V\u0103n X\u01b0\u01a1ng, indicating a specific classification or role within traditional or mythological frameworks.\n\n\u0110\u00e0 La embodies qualities of strength, bravery, and strategic acumen, marking it as a figure of considerable prowess and tactical skill.

Despite these negative traits, \u0110\u00e0 La is sometimes seen as a positive influence in astrology, though it is also associated with hindrance, obstruction, and the potential to cause defects when aligned with certain entities.\n\nIn the realm of health, \u0110\u00e0 La is listed among stars that signify illness and health issues, underscoring its role in indicating potential health-related challenges. It is recognized as one of the eight stars associated with S\u00e1t Tinh in Vietnamese astrology, a category of stars believed to negatively affect lifespan by shortening it.\n\n\u0110\u00e0 La's astrological significance extends to its association with specific locations and concepts, particularly its connection with K\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng, suggesting a place of interest or influence with specific astrological relevance. It is mentioned in contexts suggesting involvement in professional challenges, revolutionary activities with potentially violent outcomes, and as a factor in legal disputes where it embodies a refusal to surrender even after losing a lawsuit.\n\nMoreover, \u0110\u00e0 La is noted for possessing qualities valuable in both literature and martial arts, though it faces potential loss due to specific circumstances. Its mention alongside K\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng indicates its significance as a location or concept with astrological relevance. Additionally, \u0110\u00e0 La is referred to as ink, symbolizing its role in the writing process and the expression of thoughts, and represents a concept or figure associated with sexual passion, affecting relationships and considered unfortunate in love matters.\n\nIn summary, \u0110\u00e0 La is a multifaceted entity with significant astrological, mythological, and possibly geographical or cultural implications. It is associated with both positive and negative influences\",13\n257,\"\"\"KINH D\u01af\u01a0NG\"\"\",\"Kinh D\u01b0\u01a1ng is a complex entity that embodies both physical and abstract characteristics, suggesting its significance in various contexts that may include cultural, astrological, and possibly historical or mythical dimensions.

This entity is associated with a location or context that implies danger and violent tendencies, especially in adverse situations, highlighting a connection to courage and strategy. However, these traits are seen as advantageous only under specific conditions, which are further influenced by certain astrological positions considered favorable for Kinh D\u01b0\u01a1ng.\n\nThe mention of Kinh D\u01b0\u01a1ng in various contexts suggests its relevance and significance, possibly related to cultural or astrological beliefs.
