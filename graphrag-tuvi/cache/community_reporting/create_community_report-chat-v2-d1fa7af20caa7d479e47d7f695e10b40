It is associated with the star sign T\u00fd (the Rat), and its significance spans across various aspects of life, including personal fate, health, financial situations, and relationships. Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng is known for its astrological importance in indicating new beginnings or transformations, often related to fidelity, loyalty, and personal relationships. It suggests a celestial influence on marital discord, changing partners, and is even linked to the prediction of male offspring.\n\nIn terms of health, Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng has a specific association with the digestive system, though it is indicated to have a relatively poor ability to resolve illnesses related to this area. Its placement in astrological charts is crucial, as it can hint at longevity and separation from family, with certain positions suggesting weakness and leading to legal troubles and disputes. Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng's influence extends to financial aspects as well, being associated with irregular financial transactions and fluctuating financial situations.\n\nAstrologically, Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng is listed among the 14 main stars (ch\u00ednh tinh) in Vietnamese astrology, playing a significant role in astrological readings and interpretations. Its interconnectedness with other astrological entities, such as Th\u00e1i \u00c2m, Thi\u00ean L\u01b0\u01a1ng, Ph\u00e1 Qu\u00e2n, and Th\u00e1i D\u01b0\u01a1ng, underscores its importance within the astrological framework. Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng and Thi\u00ean L\u01b0\u01a1ng share similar purposes, though Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng is considered less effective in resolving conflicts and health issues. However, when combined in certain positions, they enhance charitable tendencies and are indicative of a person's virtue and significance.\n\nPhysically, Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng is described as having a slightly short and plump body, short limbs, white skin, and a square, full face. This physical description, however, seems more metaphorical, representing the star's characteristics or influence rather than a literal human form.\n\nThi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng's role in astrological discussions suggests its overarching importance in influencing human relationships, particularly in terms of marital discord and sexual or personal relationships. It symbolizes change, often associated with infidelity and changing partners, and is linked to a set of stars or astrological configurations that influence these aspects of life. Its placement in astrological texts and interpretations indicates a celestial or astrological significance, associated with specific positions that affect an individual's\",14\n410,\"\"\"THI\u00caN RI\u00caU\"\"\",\"Thi\u00ean Ri\u00eau is an astrological star with multifaceted influences on human life, according to various interpretations. It plays a significant role in astrology, affecting decisions regarding marriage, childbirth, and fertility. Thi\u00ean Ri\u00eau is also deeply associated with human passions, behaviors, and particularly with aspects of sexual desires and behaviors. This celestial entity is mentioned in the context of influencing not only human passions and behaviors but also specific physical attributes related to sexuality, suggesting a strong focus on material satisfaction over idealistic love or spirituality.\n\nMoreover, Thi\u00ean Ri\u00eau is linked to the concept of indulgence or leisurely behavior, especially in romantic or sexual relationships, symbolizing desire or sexuality. It suggests changes or renewal in sexual relationships or desires, indicating transitions or transformations in personal relationships. The star is also implied to have a tendency towards promiscuity or changing partners, representing an event or concept related to sexual behavior.\n\nIn addition to its influence on human relationships and sexuality, Thi\u00ean Ri\u00eau is associated with the digestive system, particularly the intestines, within astrological or traditional medical beliefs. It is identified as one of the five stars specifically indicating issues related to the intestines within the digestive system.\n\nThi\u00ean Ri\u00eau's role extends beyond the personal to cause defects when associated with certain other entities, and it is considered a significant location or concept within astrological or cultural beliefs. Despite its classification among stars, its exact nature remains somewhat ambiguous, as it is also mentioned in conjunction with \u0110\u00e0o Hoa and H\u1ed3ng Loan, which might indicate a person's name, a celestial body, or another concept within the same cultural or astrological framework. This ambiguity suggests that Thi\u00ean Ri\u00eau could be misclassified when it should be considered more as an event or concept, possibly related to challenges or adversities within a specific interpretative context.\n\nOverall, Thi\u00ean Ri\u00eau represents a complex astrological or geographical entity, playing a pivotal role in narratives or explanations related to human behaviors, physical health, and cultural or astrological beliefs. Its influences are broad, affecting everything from personal desires and behaviors to physical health and fertility, making it a significant, if not entirely clear, concept within the astrological framework.\",4\n1316,\"\"\"LI\u00caM S\u00c1T\"\"\",\"\"\"Li\u00eam S\u00e1t experiences both family slowdown and separation.\"\"\",1\n1315,\"\"\"LI\u00caM THAM\"\"\",\"Li\u00eam Tham is identified as an event or influence that significantly impacts marital relationships, typically in a detrimental manner.

Specifically, Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng is often compared to Thi\u00ean L\u01b0\u01a1ng, suggesting that while both play important roles or have effects in astrological contexts, Thi\u00ean \u0110\u1ed3ng might be perceived as less effective on its own.
