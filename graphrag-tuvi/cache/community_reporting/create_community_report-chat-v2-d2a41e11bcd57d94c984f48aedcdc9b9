This theory is not attributed to a single author or era but is a rich philosophical tradition that has developed since the 9th century, spanning over 63 centuries. It plays a crucial role in explaining the composition, dynamic forces, and interrelations of the natural world, as well as the structure of the universe and its influence on human life.\n\nAt its core, \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh represents the dualism of Yin and Yang, illustrating how opposite or contrary forces are interconnected and interdependent in the natural world. This concept is further enriched by the theory of the Five Elements, which describes how these elements interact and control each other, thereby forming the basis of many traditional practices, theories, and the philosophy of D\u1ecbch. The balance and transformation between Yin and Yang and the interactions among the Five Elements are emphasized, highlighting their significance in maintaining harmony in the universe and human existence.\n\nThis theory is fundamental to traditional Chinese thought and Vietnamese astrology, where it is applied to predict personal fate, describe human characteristics, and determine the optimal conditions for various aspects of life. \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh contrasts with Western scientific thought, suggesting deep differences in conceptual content and metaphysical or material stance. It is considered a fundamental aspect of Chinese philosophy and metaphysics, indicating its importance in T\u1eed-Vi astrology, a practice that emphasizes the balance and interaction of the five elements and Yin and Yang for the accuracy of astrological conclusions.\n\nMoreover, \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh is described as a system that expresses the dynamic nature and metaphysical aspects of the T\u1eed-Vi science to its extreme, involving the interplay of various external and internal factors affecting human life. It is a traditional concept that not only describes how elements interact and influence each other but also plays a crucial role in the philosophy described, affecting objects and their inherent and external properties. This theory is considered less significant in some astrological practices but is fundamental to the accuracy of conclusions in T\u1eed-Vi astrology, highlighting its application in the context of astrology to explain the properties and impacts of stars.\n\nIn summary, \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh is a traditional Chinese and Vietnamese concept that provides a comprehensive understanding of the\",6\n92,\"\"\"PH\u1ee4C HY\"\"\",\"Ph\u1ee5c Hy is a legendary figure in Chinese history, renowned for his significant contributions to ancient Chinese philosophy and divination practices.

Ph\u1ee5c Hy is also mentioned as a king who lived around 5400 years ago, making his mark 44 centuries before the common era. His reign is particularly noted for contributing to the development of the Yin and Yang and the Five Elements theory, foundational concepts in Chinese philosophy. These contributions are seen as the initial concepts of the philosophy that would later be known as the philosophy of D\u1ecbch.
