Cung N\u00f4 is described as a location or segment in astrological readings that is generally seen as unfavorable for H\u00f3a Quy\u1ec1n, suggesting a place of suppression or challenge. However, it also represents individuals under one's authority, such as teachers, professors, doctors, and business owners, highlighting its association with professions that have a significant impact on society.\n\nThe concept of Cung N\u00f4 extends to the realm of personal relationships, where it is linked to partners, significant others, and secondary partners, indicating its influence on sexual behavior and marital fidelity.
