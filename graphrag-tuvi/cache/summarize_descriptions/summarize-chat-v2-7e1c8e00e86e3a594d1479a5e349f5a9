{"result": "Kh\u1ea9m is an integral concept in Vietnamese astrology, representing an event or state that involves the draining or consumption of one's essence or fortune. It is closely associated with the element of water, which carries dual symbolism within the cultural and astrological frameworks. In the context of the eight trigrams, Kh\u1ea9m denotes danger and the unknown, highlighting the potentially perilous nature of water.
