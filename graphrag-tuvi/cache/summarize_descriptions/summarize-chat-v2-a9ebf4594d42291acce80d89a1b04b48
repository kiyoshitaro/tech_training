{"result": "Cung M\u1ec7nh is a pivotal concept in Vietnamese astrology, often referred to as the \"Life Palace\" or \"Destiny Palace,\" which plays a crucial role in determining an individual's fate or destiny. This astrological house is not a geographical location but a specific sector in one's astrological chart that significantly influences life, destiny, career choices, and personal vitality. It is deeply intertwined with the principles of Feng Shui and traditional Chinese beliefs, including the forces of \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng (Yin and Yang) and Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh (the Five Elements), indicating its comprehensive impact on a person's life force and energy.\n\nCung M\u1ec7nh is associated with various aspects of an individual's life, including personality traits, behaviors, and the spiritual or personal journey.
