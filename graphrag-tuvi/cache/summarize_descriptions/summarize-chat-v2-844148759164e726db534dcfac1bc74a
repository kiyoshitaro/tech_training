Tr\u1ea7n \u0110o\u00e0n is credited with laying out the practice of T\u1eed-Vi, aiming to turn it into a comprehensive system of divination that addresses all aspects of human life and characteristics. He is described as a forward-thinking and practical psychologist, ahead of his time for daring to express realities that were cautiously approached by Chinese philosophers and ethicists of his era.\n\nAs a Taoist priest, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110o\u00e0n made significant contributions to the early development of the T\u1eed-Vi discipline, integrating principles from both astrology and physiognomy (Nh\u00e2n t\u01b0\u1edbng h\u1ecdc). He is cited by various Chinese authors as a reference point, despite inconsistencies in the listing of stars and their names. Tr\u1ea7n \u0110o\u00e0n is credited with assigning content to each 'star', giving meanings related to individual human beings and their lives, and is described as having a humanistic conception of the stars, viewing them as part of human nature and a driving force for individuals and humanity. His approach focuses on understanding humanity not by looking at the stars but by analyzing human elements to speak of their destiny.\n\nTr\u1ea7n \u0110o\u00e0n is also mentioned in the context of fortune-telling, suggesting he may have contributed to or written about the application of \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh in predicting personal destiny. He is recognized as the founding figure of the T\u1eed-Vi school of thought, knowledgeable in both T\u1eed-Vi (astrology) and Nh\u00e2n t\u01b0\u1edbng h\u1ecdc (physiognomy), and is credited as the author of the first physiognomy book in China. His efforts to express the concept of Thi\u00ean Nh\u00e2n T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1, collecting all cosmic concepts and rules into the fate of humans seamlessly, highlight his ambition to integrate various philosophical and cultural insights into a unified system.\n\nDespite his significant contributions, Tr\u1ea7n \u0110o\u00e0n is mentioned as someone who attempted to", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
