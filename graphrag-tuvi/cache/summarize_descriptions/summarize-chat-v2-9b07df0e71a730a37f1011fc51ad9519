{"result": "Cung C\u01b0\u1eddng, within the realm of Vietnamese astrology, denotes positions of strength or power in an individual's astrological or geomantic chart. These positions, known as \"houses,\" are considered to be of significant importance due to their potential to broadly impact a person's life when they contain adverse stars. However, Cung C\u01b0\u1eddng is not solely associated with negative implications. It also refers to favorable or strong positions that are believed to ensure happiness and success in various aspects of life.
