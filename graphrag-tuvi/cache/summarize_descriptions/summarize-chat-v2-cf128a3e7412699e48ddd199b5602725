{"result": "T\u01b0\u1edbng Qu\u00e2n is an astrological term or entity deeply intertwined with martial characteristics, leadership, and a significant influence on both personal relationships and career status. It is associated with violence, coercion, and potentially negative impacts, particularly in the context of lovers or secondary spouses, as well as on one's career or status. T\u01b0\u1edbng Qu\u00e2n is often mentioned alongside Thi\u00ean T\u01b0\u1edbng, indicating a complex relationship where both entities can significantly affect an individual's life, especially in military and leadership endeavors.

Described as a courageous and bold individual, potentially a military figure, T\u01b0\u1edbng Qu\u00e2n may act rashly and with excessive pride, sometimes misusing military power. This entity is described as a martial star, associated with masculinity and military leadership, indicating a person of lower military rank who commands a small unit but can hold higher authority if paired with Thi\u00ean T\u01b0\u1edbng. T\u01b0\u1edbng Qu\u00e2n embodies courage and boldness, yet is also described as rash and potentially oppressive, characterized by being hot-tempered and willing to engage in decisive actions, especially when provoked.\n\nIn a military context, T\u01b0\u1edbng Qu\u00e2n suggests a leadership role with increased authority when joined by certain stars, indicating a person of military significance or a specific military title. It is mentioned as a counterpart to Thi\u00ean T\u01b0\u1edbng, suggesting a similar level of influence or authority, and as a supporting star that can enhance the fortunes of others, particularly in leadership and military endeavors. T\u01b0\u1edbng Qu\u00e2n symbolizes aggressive, bold, and reckless behavior, often leading to conflict or harm, yet also embodies martial characteristics, strength, a competitive spirit, and leadership qualities.\n\nAdditionally, T\u01b0\u1edbng Qu\u00e2n, along with Sao Thai, Ph\u1ee5c Binh, and \u0110\u1ebf V\u01b0\u01a1ng, is mentioned in relation to marriage, highlighting the aspect of formalizing relationships after cohabitation and dealing with children from previous relationships.
