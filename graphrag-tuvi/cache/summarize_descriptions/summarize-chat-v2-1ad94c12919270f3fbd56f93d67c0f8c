{"result": "Khoa T\u1eed-Vi is a comprehensive and multifaceted field of study or institution focusing on Vietnamese astrology, with a history spanning over 10 centuries. It employs a holistic approach to understand human life and destiny, integrating various traditional methods and principles, including the analysis of human fate and fortune through the interplay of Yin and Yang, the Five Elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water), and the concept of humans as a microcosm of the universe. This discipline emphasizes the importance of living a normal life within society, focusing on the secular happiness of individuals by prioritizing material wealth, status, and longevity, while also considering aspects such as health, family dynamics, childbirth, and interpersonal relationships.\n\nKhoa T\u1eed-Vi is conceptualized as both an academic and philosophical school that incorporates the essence of Confucianism, highlighting the dynamic forces of life and the continuous change humans undergo through events occurring every hour. It distinguishes between various elements and shorter time periods for micro-analysis, including stars with specific meanings and attributes. The field also delves into human health issues, societal behaviors, and relationships, excluding exceptional cases from its research to focus on the average human being.\n\nThe practice of Khoa T\u1eed-Vi is localized or adapted by Vietnam, featuring nine moving stars that change positions annually, and it applies the principles of \u00c2m D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u0169 H\u00e0nh to provide a nuanced understanding of human life. It values private ownership and wealth, contrasting with proletarian views, and has dedicated many stars to describe culture, emphasizing literature over martial arts, reflecting the \"tr\u1ecdng v\u0103n khinh v\u00f5\" concept in Chinese culture.\n\nKhoa T\u1eed-Vi is described as having a unique concept of humanity, viewing humans holistically in their entirety and environment. It addresses various aspects of human life, including love and sexuality, oratory talent, and the fate and fortune of individuals, rather than professional careers or technical crafts. The discipline is ambitious, aiming to understand the complex nature of human beings and their lives through analysis, synthesis, and dynamic methods. It also incorporates discussions on aesthetics and beauty standards, particularly in relation to women's beauty in Chinese culture, without setting definitive standards for beauty.\n\nThis field of study or institution is not limited to oral or written disciplines, suggesting a broad scope of knowledge and practices. It is selective in its focus, primarily concerning itself with the destinies of relatively mature individuals rather than children under 13, and it emphasizes", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
