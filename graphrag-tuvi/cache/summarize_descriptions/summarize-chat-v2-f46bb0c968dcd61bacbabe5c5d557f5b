Despite comparisons suggesting Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c's actions or decisions might be considered inferior to L\u1ed9c T\u00f4n's, Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c is also described in astrological terms as an event or condition equating to L\u1ed9c T\u1ed3n, implying a significant impact on one's financial status. This character is known for generosity and an ability to enjoy life, willing to spend money and indulge in pleasures, contrasting with a frugal or overly cautious demeanor. \n\nIn terms of lifestyle, Ho\u00e0 L\u1ed9c is noted for a more refined or delicate approach to food, lacking the robust eating habits of laborers, which suggests a connoisseur's appreciation for good food.
