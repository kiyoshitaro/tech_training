It is recognized within Vietnamese astrology for its role in predicting or determining the gender of unborn children, closely associated with Khao T\u1eed-Vi's method. In traditional Chinese astronomy, B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u refers to a specific system or constellation, often linked with the Big Dipper or the North Star, highlighting its astronomical significance. This entity is intricately connected with the birth of female children, as per the traditional astrological beliefs, and is portrayed as a deity or mythological figure akin to a fate deity, influencing human lives and shaping destinies in ancient narratives.\n\nB\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u, along with Nam \u0110\u1ea9u, forms a celestial dichotomy, representing a group of stars that embody less dynamic aspects when compared together, suggesting a balance within the celestial hemisphere. This balance is further emphasized in ancient Chinese astronomy, where B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u is seen as one half of the celestial hemisphere division, underscoring its importance in astrological classifications and its role in influencing gender ratios. Specifically, B\u1eafc \u0110\u1ea9u is associated with the birth of girls and represents female elements in astrology, linked to specific stars and indicating a predominance of females.
