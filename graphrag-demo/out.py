community_summaries = ['These human activities, notably the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are interrelated as they both contribute significantly to climate change. By burning fossil fuels, we release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. This process thereby exacerbates global warming. \n\nDeforestation, on the other hand, lessens the amount of carbon-absorbing trees on the planet and often involves burning of the trees, resulting in more carbon emissions. Furthermore, deforestation often makes way for agricultural activities, which can also produce significant greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nOverall, these human activities are directly contributing to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming and climate change.',
